											<p class="content"><span class="details">Details:</span> This is a hangman game that I<br />
											created with HTML, CSS and<br />
											JavaScript. The user has to guess the<br />
											letters of a coding-related word, and<br />
											ten "lives" (aka nine chances) to guess<br />
											an incorrect letter before losing the<br />
											game. The hardest part for me was<br />
											JavaScript, since I had just begun<br />
											learning it when I built this project.<br />
											Making a hangman game turned out to<br />
											be much more complicated than I had<br />
											expected, but I'm glad I did it and I'm<br />
											proud of how it turned out!<br />
											<span class="details">Percent finished:</span> 95%. Although it is<br />
											functional, there are some details I <br />
											would like to add, such as a stick figure <br />
											"hangman" animation and restricting of<br />
											input characters to letters.<br />

												<p class="content"><span class="details">Details: </span>This is website for a local<br />
													acupuncture practice. It was built with<br />
													HTML and CSS, plus a little jQuery. Not<br />
													having creative agency and figuring<br />
													out how turn someone else's vision into<br />
													a real website were new types of<br />
													challenges. Although code-wise this was<br />
													not my most challenging or exciting<br />
													project, learning about the other types<br />
													of obstacles that come up in this line<br />
													of work was an invaluable experience.<br />
										
													<span class="details">Percent finished: </span>90%. This website<br />
													accomplishes everything the bussiness'<br />
													owners and I agreed on beforehand.<br />
													However, it's not responsive on all<br />
													devices, which is very important for a<br />
													deployed webiste. So far it's reponsive<br />
													on iPad, iPad Pro, and iPhone X.

												<p class="content"><span class="details">Details:</span> This is Fitness Friends, a<br />
													social application for fitness lovers.<br />
													This was my first group project, and<br />
													taught me a lot about developing as a<br />
													team. We used GitFlow Workflow,<br />
													which was very useful. This was built<br />
													with CSS, React, Redux, Express, Node,<br />
													MongoDB, and AJAX. My role was<br />
													primarily in the front-end. I did a large<br />
													portion of the work in React, and all of<br />
													the styling. My favorite part of this<br />
													project was working in React.<br />
												<span class="details">Percent finished:</span> 50%. We've<br />
												laid most of the groundwork, but we<br />
												have a ways to go before this<br />
												application is finished. That being said,<br />
												I'm still proud of the work I did,<br /> particulalry in React and Redux.<br />

											media app to connect dog owners with<br />
											each other. This is the only application<br />
											I've built using Express, which I found<br />
											challenging. Although Express doesn't<br />
											come as naturally to me as some of the<br />
											other technologies I've explored, with<br />
											a little extra effort I figured it out. I<br />
											styled using CSS and Bootstrap, and<br />
											used Handlbars to render my views<br />
											on the front end.<br />
											
											
											<span class="details">Percent finished: </span>65%. It's only<br />
											partially functional, with a lot to<br />
											implement before it's finished. I plan to<br />
											replace Handlbars with React. Like<br />
											Fitness Friends, although the project is<br />
											incomplete, there's a lot I'm proud of--<br />
											in this case, my work in Express<br />

										<span class="details">Percent Finished: </span>50%. The navigation is<br />
