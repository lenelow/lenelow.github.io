								<div class="blah">
									This is a hangman game that uses nothing but HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The user has to guess the letters of a 
									coding-related word, and has nine opportunities to guess an incorrect letter before losing the game.<br />
									The hardest part for me was JavaScript, since I had just begun learning it when I built this project. Making a hangman 
									game turned out to be much more difficult than I had expected, but I'm glad I did it and I'm proud of how it turned out!

								<div class="blahblah">
									This is website for a local acupuncture practice that's opening this month. It was built 
									with HTML and CSS. This experience was very different from building projects for General Assembly.
									Not having creative agency and figuring out the best way to turn someone's vision into a real website were new
									types of challenges. Although code-wise this was not my most challenging or exciting project, 
									learning about the other types of challeneges that come up in this line of work was an invaluable experience.

									This application is called Fitness Friends, and it was made for fitness lovers who are looking for other fitness lovers exercise with.
									This was my first time doing a group project. Originally, I assumed working with others would mean less work, but it
									ended up creating more work. Developing an applicatoin with as a group requires additional planning and coordination, as well as a lot of
									discussion and working to agree on the details of the project. We used GitFlow Workflow, which was very useful. 
									This project was made using CSS, React and Redux on the front-end, and Express, Node, MongoDB, and AJAX on the back-end. My role was primarily in the front end. 
									I did a large portion of the work in React, and I did all of the styling. My favorite part of this project was working in React.
